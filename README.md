firewall rule cleaner and capability enhancer 


# Time to get Started with the - Enhanced Firewall Rule Cleaner Tool

## Overview
This tool is designed to manage and optimize firewall rules with advanced capabilities:
1. **Traffic Analysis and Usage Trends**: Identifies unused or low-traffic rules based on recent traffic logs.
2. **Advanced Rule Recommendation Engine**: Suggests rule consolidations and optimizations based on industry standards.
3. **Security Impact Analysis**: Assigns risk scores to firewall rules, highlighting high-risk configurations.
4. **Rule Simulation and Impact Forecasting**: Simulates the impact of rule changes in a sandboxed environment before deployment.

## Features
- **Traffic Analysis**: Flags low-usage rules for cleanup.
- **Rule Recommendations**: Suggests consolidations or adjustments based on best practices.
- **Risk-Based Scoring**: Calculates security risk scores for each rule.
- **Impact Simulation**: Forecasts the effect of potential rule changes.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/firewall-rule-cleaner-enhanced.git
    cd firewall-rule-cleaner-enhanced
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Open `config.json` to define log paths, risk scoring weights, compliance templates, and other parameters.
   - Customize settings as per your environment.

## Usage
1. **Run the Firewall Rule Cleaner**:
    ```bash
    python firewall_rule_cleaner.py
    ```
   - Analyzes traffic patterns, generates rule recommendations, and simulates potential impacts.

2. **Configuration File (`config.json`)**:
   - Define parameters for traffic analysis, risk thresholds, compliance templates, and sandbox path for simulations.

## Configuration Example (`config.json`)
```json

    }
}
```
